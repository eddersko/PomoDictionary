About
=====
This language app is part of a project to archive and make available materials on the Northern Pomo language, collected over 25 years. These material exist due to the dedication and work of Edna Campbell Guerrero and Elenor Stevenson Gonzales, both native speakers of Northern Pomo. This app was designed by Elodie Paquette, implemented in iOS by Elodie Paquette and Josh Leibsly, and implemented in Android by Edwin Ko. It was supported in part by a grant from the NEH/NSF Documenting Endangered Languages program (FN-50107-12) to Catherine O'Connor, which is gratefully acknowledged.
