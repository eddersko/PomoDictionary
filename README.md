About
=====
This language app is part of a project to archive and make available materials on the Northern Pomo language, collected over 25 years. These material exist due to the dedication and work of Edna Campbell Guerrero and Elenor Stevenson Gonzales, both native speakers of Northern Pomo. This app was designed by Elodie Paquette, implemented in iOS by Elodie Paquette and Josh Leibsly, and implemented in Android by Edwin Ko. It was supported in part by a grant from the NEH/NSF Documenting Endangered Languages program (FN-50107-12) to Catherine O'Connor, which is gratefully acknowledged. Views expressed in this material are the work of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. National Science Foundation or National Endowment for the Humanities. This material may not be sold.

This code is fully adaptable and available for use by others. All changes should be made in Word.java where all the data is kept. AboutActivity.java and activity_about refer to the about page and can be freely modified. Questions about the source code within the repository can be directed towards Edwin Ko at either eddersko@bu.edu or ek684@georgetown.bu.edu.
